This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This was a really good challenege to build a calendar application in a very limited amount of time. I realized that I may havve tried to add too much in terms of functionality, and as a result did not get a minimum viable product working. 

If given more time I would:

1. keep building out my functionality to add/edit events in each day and have them append into the given date on the calendar.
2. Write tests to make sure the app is functioning correctly
3. Add Moment.js in order to get the correct dates appending on the calendar.

To get set up using this project, you will need to first run 

```
npm install
```

This should download all dependencies and allow you to start up the app.


In the project directory, run:

### `npm start`

to open the project in development mode.
